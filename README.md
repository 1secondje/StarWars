# Star Wars React App

The Star Wars React App is a feature-rich application that allows users to explore information about the Star Wars universe. It utilizes various technologies and libraries, including React, React Router DOM, Redux, Redux Thunk, React Context, React Lazy, SWAPI API, and more. The app offers the following functionality:

## Theme Switching

The application provides a seamless theme switching feature using React Context. Users can toggle between light and dark themes to customize their viewing experience.

## Routing

React Router DOM is employed for efficient and smooth navigation within the application. Users can easily explore different pages and components without page reloads.

## Redux State Management

Redux is used for state management in the Star Wars React App. It provides a centralized store where application state can be stored and managed effectively.

## Asynchronous Data Fetching

Redux Thunk is utilized to handle asynchronous actions, particularly fetching data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API). This allows the app to retrieve and display the desired information about Star Wars characters and other entities.

## React Hooks

Several React hooks, including useCallback, useRef, useState, and useEffect, are used to handle various aspects of the application's logic and state management. These hooks provide flexibility and enhance the performance of the app.

## Higher Order Components (HOC)

The Star Wars React App utilizes Higher Order Components (HOC) to enhance the behavior and functionality of components. This enables the app to provide additional features and extensibility.

## React Lazy

React Lazy is implemented in the app to load components lazily. This optimizes performance by loading components only when they are needed, resulting in faster rendering and improved user experience.

## Additional Features

The Star Wars React App includes the following additional features and libraries:

- `useLocation` and `useHistory` hooks from React Router DOM for managing and accessing location and navigation history.
- `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks from Redux for interacting with the Redux store and retrieving state information.
- The lodash library for utility functions, providing helpful methods for data manipulation and handling.
- Viewing character cards fetched from the SWAPI API. Users can browse through the available character cards, each displaying detailed information about a specific character from the Star Wars universe.

Experience the Star Wars React App and dive into the vast world of Star Wars like never before! May the Force be with you!
